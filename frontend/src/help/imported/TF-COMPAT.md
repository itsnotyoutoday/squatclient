# pkg/tf compatibility matrix

Status legend: **Done** (works as described in `TF-LANGUAGE.md`), **Partial**
(works with the stated difference), **Planned (P2)**, **GUI** (replaced by a GUI
feature, the host decides), **N/A** (not applicable to this client).

`pkg/tf` is a clean-room implementation inspired by TinyFugue's documented
behaviour; it contains no TinyFugue code or help text. The checklist is the
list in `squatClient/docs/DESIGN.md` section 3.2. Those lists were written from
TinyFugue's `cmdlist.h`, `funclist.h`, `hooklist.h`, `varlist.h`; the semantics
below were implemented from knowledge of the public manual, **not verified
against a reference binary yet** (the oracle differential tests of DESIGN 3.5
are not set up), so treat every "Done" as "implemented to the documented
intent". Where TF's exact behaviour was uncertain the most sensible semantics
were chosen and are noted here.

## 1. Deliberate differences (read these first)

| Area                      | TinyFugue-style                                  | Here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Expression substitution   | `%` text substitution happens inside expressions | Inside `$[..]`, `/if (..)` etc. `%x`, `%1`, `%*`, `%{x}` are **variable references** (never re-parsed as expression text); `%` is not interpolated in string literals. Removes a code-injection hazard from MUD text.                                                                            |
| `=~` `!~` `=/` `!/`       | as defined by TF                                 | `=~`/`!~`: exact string equal / not equal. `=/`/`!/`: **glob** match (pattern on the right). Regexps via `regmatch()` or `-mregexp`.                                                                                                                                                             |
| No modulo operator        | n/a                                              | use `mod()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Trigger firing            | one random macro among equal priorities          | deterministic: priority desc, then definition order; the first fires, `-F` continues. Only one macro per priority level fires unless `-F`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Glob captures             | none                                             | every wildcard of a glob trigger is `%P1..` (`%P0` the whole line).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Statement splitting       |                                                  | text lines (not starting `/`) are never split at `;`; `/def`, `/repeat`, `/eval` keep `%;` for later.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Script files              | non-command lines are sent as text               | non-command lines in a loaded file are an **error** (no accidental sends). Unclosed blocks in a file are an error.                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `/def` of a built-in name |                                                  | the macro shadows the built-in; `/builtin cmd` reaches the built-in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Backquote `` `cmd` `` substitution is **not** implemented (it implied a shell).                                                                                                                                             |

## 1a. Policy: terminal-only TinyFugue features are out of scope

SquatClient is a GUI client. Anything TinyFugue has _only because it ran in a text terminal_ is **not implemented and not planned**.
Scripts that use them still load: the commands/variables are **accepted and ignored** (no error), so a `.tf` file written for the
terminal does not break here. Where a GUI equivalent exists, it is a UI setting, not a TF command.

| TF feature                                                                                                                                      | Why it is out                                  | Here                                                                                       |

| `more`, `/more`-style paging, `morepaused`/`morescroll`/`moresize`                                                                              | Terminal paging prompt                         | UI "pause when scrolled up" (settings.pauseOnScroll); functions return 0/neutral values    |

| `/redraw`, `/refresh`-style screen repaint, `/suspend`, `/core`, terminal signals (`SIGHUP`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGUSR*` hooks)                        | Terminal/process control                       | no-op / N/A                                                                                |
| Terminal geometry: status line rows, `status_width` layout details, `isatty`, `termcap`/`TERM` handling, `/lcd`-style cursor handling           | Terminal-specific                              | status _fields_ are kept (they drive the GUI status bar); geometry is the window's concern |
| Keyboard-buffer functions (`kbhead kbtail kbpoint kbgoto kbdel kblen kbmatch kbwordleft kbwordright kb_visual_move`) and `kb*.tf`-style keymaps | Input line is a GUI widget                     | low priority: may be exposed later over the input widget; not required                     |
| `/sh`, `/quote !`, `/ps`/`/kill` process commands                                                                                               | Shell access                                   | kept only behind `/restrict` (default: denied), not terminal-dependent                     |

`columns()` and `lines()` are kept and return the output pane's size in characters (useful to scripts); NAWS uses the same numbers.

## 4. Hooks

All 35 names are accepted by `/def -h`, `/hook` and `FireHook`. "Engine" means
the engine is expected to call `FireHook`; "Interp" means the interpreter fires
it itself.

## 5. Variables

Reconstructed from memory of TinyFugue's variable list (not verified against
`varlist.h`). "Read" means the interpreter acts on it; "Stored" means it is an
ordinary variable with a default that scripts may read and set, with no effect
on this client unless the host chooses to honour it.

| Variable(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Status                                                                                           |

## 6. Not done (summary)

- No differential/oracle testing against a real `tf` binary yet.
- `%{-N}` argument ranges, backquote command substitution, `/edit`, `/recordline`,
  streams (`tfopen` family), `/watchdog`, `/watchname`, grapheme functions,
  `encode_ansi/decode_ansi`, keyboard-buffer functions, most P2 hooks.
- `/list` filters, `/save` of variables.
- IANA time zones.
